With a strong educational background from AltSchool Africa and hands-on experience as a Data Engineering/MLOps intern at hamoye.com, I am dedicated to leveraging data to drive insights and create impactful solutions. My expertise spans Python, PostgreSQL, GCP, Apache Beam, ETL, and Airflow enabling me to contribute effectively to data engineering projects.

Over the year I have engaged myself in projects that bring together data science, data analytics, and data engineering; developed and maintained prediction systems that help to discover hidden insights and provide a better view of ways to solve problems that drive the company’s growth and stability.

I am experienced in Mlops (mlflow, evidently AI), big data tools (beam, airflow, docker ), and the use of data visualization techniques to present the results. I use SQL, Python, and cloud technologies (GCP, AWS) for my data projects and am very good at providing solutions to problems that stomp your company's data-driven decisions.
