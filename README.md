### 🚀 About Me

I'm a passionate DevOps & Data Engineer with a strong foundation in cloud-native infrastructure, blockchain protocols, and scalable data systems. From humble beginnings as a curious learner, I’ve grown into a **senior team member and founding engineer at GlueX Protocol**, where I manage mission-critical infrastructure across multiple blockchain networks and cloud platforms.

I’ve built full-node setups, indexing systems, stress-test frameworks, observability pipelines, and autoscaling environments using AWS, Linux, and modern DevOps stacks. 

#### ✅ Node Infrastructure Experience
I have hands-on experience or deep research knowledge in setting up and managing nodes across:

`Ethereum`, `Arbitrum`, `Base`, `Blast`, `Linea`, `Scroll`, `Mantle`, `Polygon`, `Optimism`, `Gnosis`, `BNB Chain`, `Berachain`, `Unichain`, `Sonic`, `Avalanche`, `Sei`, `Taiko`, and `Hyperevm`.

### 💼 Background

With an educational foundation from **AltSchool Africa**(graduated as the Top Data Engineering performer) and a previous role as a **Data Engineering/MLOps Intern at Hamoye**, I’ve worked on systems that transform raw data into actionable insight, while improving reliability, traceability, and deployment agility.

I’ve contributed to projects spanning **on-chain data engineering**, **custom blockchain indexers**, **Microservices**, **monitoring dashboards (Grafana, Prometheus, Loki)**, **ETL pipelines**, and **AWS cost-optimized infra**.
